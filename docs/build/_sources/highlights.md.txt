# Salient Features

## Streamlined

The pipeline's heart is the new_config.yaml file, which contains all modifiable properties of the software used in one place.
For more info on this file, go {ref}`here <complex_tutorials:configuration file>`.

## Maintaining project structure

Another prominent feature of this pipeline is the ability to capture folder structure of the fastqs and provide the ability to organize the outputs of various programs in a similar (with varying structures but using all wildcards) manner. To understand this ability more go [here](complex_tutorials.md).

## Easy modification or addition of rules

To modify rules (adding extra params) is easy (add_here the extra params option in STARsolo
)
## One-select running of popular workflows

Many {ref}`pre-selected workflows <modules:module description>` are present in the pipeline
## Easy resource maintenance
## Re-attempts for known issues or errors
