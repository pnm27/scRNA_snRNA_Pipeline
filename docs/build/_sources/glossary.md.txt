   pooled sample
      A sample using cell hashing, where oligo-tagged antibodies against ubiquitously expressed surface proteins uniquely label cells from distinct samples, which can be subsequently pooled\ :cite:p:`Stoeckius2018-yw` and be run as a single experiment.

   preprocessing
      To produce gene count matrix file, which can be directly used for an analysis pipeline. For example, in the case of pooled samples this means to retain either one gene count matrix file with each cell attributed to the *donor of origin* or to produce individual gene count matrix file for each donor

   DAG
      Directed Acyclic Graph. Click :ref:`here <sub_workflows:overview of the pipeline>` for an example
