  abstract  = "Despite rapid developments in single cell sequencing,
               sample-specific batch effects, detection of cell multiplets, and
               experimental costs remain outstanding challenges. Here, we
               introduce Cell Hashing, where oligo-tagged antibodies against
               ubiquitously expressed surface proteins uniquely label cells
               from distinct samples, which can be subsequently pooled. By
               sequencing these tags alongside the cellular transcriptome, we
               can assign each cell to its original sample, robustly identify
               cross-sample multiplets, and ``super-load'' commercial
               droplet-based systems for significant cost reduction. We
               validate our approach using a complementary genetic approach and
               demonstrate how hashing can generalize the benefits of single
               cell multiplexing to diverse samples and experimental designs.",
